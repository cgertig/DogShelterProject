# Dog Shelter Project

##Introduction
This is a project designed in Python to calculate the amount of food a shelter will need given the number of dogs(based on size) and the amount of food (in lbs) presently in the shelter. This program will also calculate an additional 20% increase to the amount of food required in order to ensure the shelter is able to feed all the dogs in the shelter.
